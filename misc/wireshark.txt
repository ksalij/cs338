====== DAYTIME ========

1. Identify the parts of the TCP 3-way handshake by listing the frame summaries of the relevant frames.
- Header: No.  Time  Source  Desitination  Protocol  Length  Info
	1  0.000000000  192.168.224.128  129.6.15.28  TCP  74  59464 -> 13 [SYN]...
	2  0.043182013  129.6.15.28  192.168.224.128  TCP  60  13 -> 59464 [SYN, ACK]...
	3  0.043513572  192.168.224.128  129.6.15.28  TCP  54  59464 -> 13 [ACK]...

2. What port number does the client (i.e. nc on your Kali computer) use for this interaction?
	59464

3. Why does the client need a port?
	Otherwise the server doesn't know exactly what software on the client it is talking to.

4. What frame contains the actual date and time? (Show the frame summary as in question 1 above.)
	4 0.079686671 129.6.15.28 192.168.224.128 DAYTIME 105 DAYTIME Response

5. What is the full content (not counting the Ethernet, IP, and TCP headers) of the frame? What do each of the pieces of the frame content represent? (Most of the frame content is things like the year, month, day, hour, etc., but there's a little more info, too.)
	Type: Response
	Daytime: \n60202 23-09-15 14:50:10 50 0 0 226.5 UTC(NIST) * \n
	
	Wireshark lets us know that this Frame was a response to a request. The first number after the newline character is the number of days after a certain date. The next chunk is the date in the form of year-month-day. 14:40:10 is the hour:min:sec according to UTC(NIST) time which is NIST's representation of UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). 

6. What does [SYN] mean?
	synchronize: first packet sent to establish connection between client and server

7. What does [ACK] mean?
	acknowlege: acknowledges the successful recieval of packets

8. What does [FIN] mean?
	finish: requests an end to the connection

9. Which entity (the nc client or the daytime server) initiated the closing of the TCP connection? How can you tell?
	The nc client initiated the closing because the source IP address for the frame with the [FIN] flag is the address associated with the client.

============ HTTP ==============

1. How many TCP connections were opened? How can you tell?
	I think 2 connections because there were two [SYN] packets sent from my client to the server from two separate ports (33008 -> 80 and 33012 -> 80). 2 [SYN, ACK] packets were then by the server to the respective ports. 

2. Can you tell where my homepage (index.html) was requested? (If not, why not? If so, include frame summaries and/or other info that supports your answer.)
	Yes because in one of the frames summaries the protocol is HTTP, and in the info section, it says GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 which looks like it is requesting /index.html from cs338.jeffondich.com. 
	5  0.0132377  192.168.224.128  45.79.89.123  HTTP  408 GET /index.html HTTP1.1

3. Can you tell where my photograph (jeff_square_head.jpg) was requested? (If not, why not? If so, include frame summaries and/or other info that supports your answer.)
	Yes. In one of the frame summaries, the protocol is HTTP, and in the info secion, it says GET /jeff_square_head.jpg HTTP/1.1 which looks like it is requesting the file jeff_square_head.jpg from cs338.jeffondich.com.
	11  0.228754314  192.168.224.128  45.79.89.123  HTTP 377 GET /jeff_square_head.jpg HTTP/1.1

=========== QUESTIONS ===========
This isn't a super general question, but when I was scanning through the packets/frames, I found a 404 Not Found error, but it had found the packet eariler (text/html). So I guess my question is, when do those errors get sent out? When does the client communicate that it can't find a certain file?
Also, what is a [PSH, ACK] flag?
